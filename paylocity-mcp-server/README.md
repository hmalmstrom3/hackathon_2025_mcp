# Running the server
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Add `http://localhost:3000/sse` as a streamable http MCP server in client of choice

# Testing the server
* Option 1: Add the server to a client
* Option 2: Use the command `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:3000/sse` to run the inspector and open `http://localhost:6274`
* Option 3: Open `http://localhost:3000/` (doesn't work for some reason)

# Adding a new API
1. Clone the `ExternalDeveloperPortalSpecifications` repo
2. Generate a temp MCP server with `npx openapi-mcp-generator@2.5.1-beta.1 --input "C:\Paylocity\ExternalDeveloperPortalSpecifications\production\Latest Version\Employee Demographic API.json" --output paylocity-mcp-server-temp --transport=web --port=3000 --force`
  * Note the `-temp` in the output
3. Copy the `toolDefinitionMap` from temp `index.ts` to it's own file in the main mcp server project `tools` folder
4. Add imports
5. export the `toolDefinitionMap` to the `tools/index.ts` and merge with other maps

# Changes from project generated by `openapi-mcp-generator`
* Commented out headers in `web-server.ts` since they are now generated in the mcp server sdk
* Commented out the initial response write (it was causing issues with the headers sent later)
* Moved `toolDefinitionMap` and type definition to own folder
* Added `req.body` parameter to `await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res, req.body);` since it is now needed from the sdk
* Changed package name
