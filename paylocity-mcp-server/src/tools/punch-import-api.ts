      description: `**Summary Description**
  
  The POST Punch Import API endpoint is an API that interfaces with the Paylocity Time and Labor module. The API is designed to streamline importing time data from external systems.
  
  **This API offers a method for importing punch data, complementing the other two methods: File import through the application and file import vis SFTP:**
  - The API allows a 62-day window for importing punch data- it accepts data for the previous 31 days, given that the pay periods are open and for the upcoming 31 days.
  -  Any punches outside this timeframe will not be accepted. This feature allows users to seamlessly integrate their time-tracking systems with the Paylocity platform, enhancing efficiency and data accuracy.`,
