      description: `**Summary Description**
  
   The Paylocity Pay Entry API is a powerful tool designed to streamline and automate payroll processes. It enables API users to transmit crucial payroll data, such as time tracking, earnings, deductions, and taxes. A batch is posted to Paylocity and is added to the Pay Entry Screen for the corresponding check date. This API Endpoint ensures accuracy and efficiency in the payroll process and reduces manual importing, making it a valuable tool for streamlining inputting Payroll data from an external system. 
  
   **Pay Entry Use Cases:** 
  
   - One of the key applications of the Pay Entry API is to facilitate the transmission of payroll batch data from a third-party system to Paylocity's Pay Entry. From here, users can set up a payroll for a specific check date and process it, incorporating the batch data transmitted via the API.`,
